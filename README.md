GAHH (please do not spook me again by visiting my github .-.)

Its me Justin.

I am still learning about what I need to learn and I feel like that cannot stop

And then I have to learn that thing but then learning HOW to learn that thing becomes a whole other thing

As you can see, I haven't learnt how to write my own README so you'll have to excuse me for that

My interests can change every 2 months or so, but the following are things I will always have space for:
- Education
- Music
- Games
- Finding that darn meaning of life everyone's talking about
- The 90s sitcom Frasier
